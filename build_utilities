  # Makefile inside FPC has a few problems on Windows.
  #
  # Summary:
  # It's easiest to just avoid them by using utilities (like pwd.exe)
  # distributed by FPC (here we just reuse them from FPC 3.2.2 installation)
  # and relying they are placed in a directory without spaces (which is true
  # at least on GH-hosted Windows runners).
  # That's what we now do.
  #
  # Past problems and attempts:
  #
  # 1. At times, FPC Makefile wants native path (not MSys2/Cygwin path).
  #    This is understandable, but then they try to obtain it by looking for
  #    /cygdrive prefix and search+replace in Makefile, instead of using more
  #    reliable "cygpath --mixed ..." to convert paths. The latter would work
  #    on both MSys2 and Cygwin, and would work for all paths, e.g. /home/...
  #    (which doesn't start with /cygdrive but is still a Cygwin path).
  #
  #    Failing to solve it may result in "make ..." error, and FPC saying it cannot
  #    find unit system used by pp. You will see it is passing -Fu/cygwin/path
  #    to ppc*, and thus it's a Cygwin path.
  #
  # 2. Makefile inside FPC has problems when `pwd.exe` is present in a directory
  #    with space in path.
  #    The Makefile does PWD:=$(strip $(wildcard $(addsuffix /pwd,$(SEARCHPATH))))
  #    and will fail to find PWD when there is space in path.
  #    And this is the case on GH-hosted Windows runner, where pwd.exe
  #    is inside "C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/".
  #
  #    They could have used "which pwd", which would be more reliable, but didn't...
  #
  #    Symptom: "make ..." fails with "You need the GNU utils package to use this Makefile".
  #
  #    Solution is to use our ${WORKSPACE_ROOT_UNIX}/fpc-build-resources/install/binwXX .
